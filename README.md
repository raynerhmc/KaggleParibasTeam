- We can not upload any .csv file, because it exceeds the maximum size file allowed by Github. (This rule is already in the .gitignore file).

- However, Input Folder is meant to be the folder that contains test.csv and train.csv. Thus, you can(must!) locally add these files. 

- The other forders belong to each team member, you can modify anything in your folder.
